    This is the only class you *need* to implement. The current skeleton has a
    basic do-nothing implementation.
    You can modify any parts of it as you need. You can act in the world by
    calling methods in the agent-world-interface instantiated as `self.awi`
    in your agent. See the documentation for more details


    **Please change the name of this class to match your agent name**

    Remarks:
        - You can get a list of partner IDs using `self.negotiators.keys()`. This will
          always match `self.awi.my_suppliers` (buyer) or `self.awi.my_consumers` (seller).
        - You can get a dict mapping partner IDs to `NegotiationInfo` (including their NMIs)
          using `self.negotiators`. This will include negotiations currently still running
          and concluded negotiations for this day. You can limit the dict to negotiations
          currently running only using `self.active_negotiators`
        - You can access your ufun using `self.ufun` (See `StdUFun` in the docs for more details).
